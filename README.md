# 32-bit-CPU
Design with Logisim a 32-bit two-cycle processor

I did this project for CS61C at UC Berkeley (Spring 2015):
http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/sp15/projs/02/index.html

The processor contains four major parts: register files, arithmetic logical unit (ALU), CPU and memory. The instruction set architecture (ISA) is specified in the above link.
